EVENTUPLOAD, INC.
Privacy Policy
Effective Date:  March 1, 2015.

<p>Welcome to EventUpload!  

<p>This Privacy Policy discloses EventUpload, Inc.’s (“EventUpload”, “we”, “us” or “our”) privacy practices and procedures in connection with EventUpload’s website located at www.EventUpload.io and the services made available through that website or through downloadable applications we make available to you, as well as all related services (collectively, the “Website”), and any information, text, graphics, photos or other materials posted or submitted on the Website (“Content”).  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by or in connection with the Website.  We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new Privacy Policy to our Website at www.EventUpload.io.  Your access and use of the Website, including all services available therein, is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our separate Terms and Conditions of Use [LINK]. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use [LINK].

<p>Our Website’s primary objective is to provide you with personalized event information.  In order to be able to provide you with personalized event information, we need to know some information about you and your event preferences.

<p>What personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

<p>Personal Information

<p>Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information (as defined below) is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.  This allows us to provide services and features that are more likely to meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier.  We only collect Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.  “Personal Information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number or e-mail address) or other information about that individual that is directly linked to Personal Information.  Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of our Website and our services.
<p>We collect and store information, including Personal Information, that is voluntarily supplied to us by you when registering or when using the Website.  Some such information is required in order for you to register as a user on our Website.  You agree to provide us with truthful information.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but by doing so, you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features and functionality.  For example, but without limitation, if you provide us with information about events that may interest you, we will use that Personal Information to match you with events that we believe may be interesting to you.  We may also use other Personal Information to match you with events that we believe may interest you, but we may not be as accurate if you do not provide us with information about the types of events that you are interested in.  Some events are age-restricted, and so we require you to provide us with your birthday before we register your account.  We use Personal Information to deliver the Website to you, to improve our services, including advertising, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allows us and affiliates of our Website to use our Website.
<p>Payment Information
<p>When you activate an account, we collect information such as your name, email address, password, and security questions and answers.  When you save a payment card in your account, we collect the type (such as credit or debit) and brand of card (such as MasterCard or Visa), the card issuer, and partial card account numbers.  When a card is used, we collect the amount of the transaction, the time and date of the transaction, and the identity of the merchant where the card was used.  For any prepaid cards we may also collect the card balance.  Finally, we may receive information about the status of your card, such as if it is suspended or cancelled, from your card issuer.
Your Content
<p>We also collect and store your Content.  Our default is almost always to make such Content public for as long as you do not delete it from the Website and such Content is broadly and instantly disseminated.  Before posting or submitting Content, you should think carefully about what you are making public.

<p>If you choose to create a public profile on the Website, we may collect other users’ comments about you in our feedback area.
Mobile Use
<p>If you visit or use our Website on a mobile device or use our mobile application, if any, we may collect information from your device, including device ID, your mobile carrier, and your physical (GPS) location.  We may store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user verification) or recommend events that are in your area and may be of interest to you.  We do not share your location information with third parties.  Depending on your device, you may turn off location services by going to your device settings.
<p>Once you have established your account on your mobile device, we collect information we receive from your mobile device, such as your device’s type, number and the serial number of its chip.  We also collect all payment card and transaction information.
<p>Use of the Website on a mobile device may allow your mobile carrier or other access provider to view data that appears on the device as a result.
What non-personally identifiable information do we collect and how do we use it?
<p>We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is automatically generated when you use the Website.  We automatically track certain information based upon your use of the Website.  We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.
<p>Cookies
We may use “cookies” on the Website.  A cookie is a piece of alphanumeric data stored on a Website visitor’s hard drive to help us improve the visitor’s access to our Website and identify repeat visitors to our Website.  Cookies enable us to customize and enhance the user experience on our Website.  We use the resulting non-personally identifiable information, such as your browser version, IP address, referring domains, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, the nature of your use of the Website and cookie information, to improve our Website, including advertising, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allow us to use our Website and reach out to you via our Website.  
<p>We may set a persistent cookie to store your password, so you do not have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas of our Website may be limited.
<p>Log Files
Like many websites, we automatically gather certain information about our Website traffic and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base.
<p>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We may and our third party advertising affiliates may employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information.
<p>To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, see “Third Party Advertisers.”
<p>We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”
<p>Embedded Scripts
<p>We may use embedded scripts, which are programming code that collects information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Website.  In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.

<p>Profile 
<p>We may store information that we collect through cookies, and log files, and/or clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences.

We share your profile with third parties in aggregate form only.
<p>Enhancement of Profile Information
