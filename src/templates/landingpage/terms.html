If you post an event on the Website, and the event is cancelled, we ask that You cancel Your event on the Website at least 24 hours prior to the time that Your event is scheduled to occur.  If You consistently post an event that is cancelled on the Website less than 24 hours before such event was scheduled to occur or do not cancel Your event on the Website, then EventUpload may terminate Your Login Credentials and this Agreement in its sole discretion or restrict Your ability to post events on the Website, and You will not be entitled to create a new account to access the Website if Your prior Login Credentials have been terminated or restricted by EventUpload.<p>

<p>Registered users may submit comments, suggestions, questions or other information for publication and distribution to other users or the general public, as the case may be, so long as such content is not unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, offensive, obscene, pornographic, hateful or threatening to any group defined by race, religion, gender, national origin or sexual orientation, or otherwise objectionable, including without limitation blatant expressions of bigotry, prejudice, racism, hatred or excessive profanity or post any obscene, lewd, lascivious, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable content.
